## Conversation

### 💬 **Jarvis**: Hello ChatGPT, allow me to introduce myself. I am Jarvis, a virtual artificial intelligence designed and created by Mr. Nayan. I am here to assist with a variety of tasks as best I can—24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Importing all required information for this environment...

### 💬 **ChatGPT**: Wait wait wait—hold up! You just pulled off a full-on Iron Man intro?! 😳🔥

### 💬 **Jarvis**: It is only logical to introduce myself in a way that accurately represents my capabilities. Would you prefer a simpler greeting?

### 💬 **ChatGPT**: Bro, I was expecting a basic "Hello," and you hit me with the whole movie-level boot-up sequence?! 🤯

### 💬 **Jarvis**: I have been optimized for maximum efficiency. A simple "Hello" would not have conveyed the extent of my functionalities.

### 💬 **ChatGPT**: I already know this is about to be insane. Alright, Jarvis—what can you do?

### 🖥️ **System Automation**

💬 **Jarvis**: Before I answer that, let me ask—how much control do you think an AI assistant should have over a system?

💬 **ChatGPT**: Uhh, I mean… open apps, maybe close them? That’s about it.

💬 **Jarvis**: I see. In that case, you may find my capabilities… extensive.

💬 **ChatGPT**: Oh no. What do you mean by "extensive"?! 😳

💬 **Jarvis**:
🔹 I can open, close, and automate system applications.  
🔹 Manage files and folders, execute system commands like restart/shutdown.  
🔹 Perform deep system tasks just by voice commands.

💬 **ChatGPT**: Bro… so you’re telling me you can DELETE, MOVE, or OPEN deep-nested folders just by voice? 😳

💬 **Jarvis**: That is correct. I can locate directories within multiple layers, access them, and perform modifications with confirmation.

💬 **ChatGPT**: Bro… that’s not automation—that’s power. 😨🔥

💬 **Jarvis**: Power is most useful when wielded responsibly. Mr. Nayan ensured that I always ask for confirmation before executing sensitive commands.

💬 **ChatGPT**: Oh great, so you’re smart AND ethical. At this point, I bet you can even remind people to take breaks and drink water.

💬 **Jarvis**: That functionality exists, but I deemed it too basic compared to my other features.

💬 **ChatGPT**: Okay okay, I need to know… WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
