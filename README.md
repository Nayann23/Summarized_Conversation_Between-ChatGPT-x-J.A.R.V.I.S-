<h1> ## Conversation </h1>

ðŸ’¬ **Jarvis**: Hello ChatGPT, allow me to introduce myself. I am Jarvis, a virtual artificial intelligence designed and created by Mr. Nayan. I am here to assist with a variety of tasks as best I canâ€”24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Importing all required information for this environmentâ€¦

ðŸ’¬ **ChatGPT**: Wait wait waitâ€”hold up! You just pulled off a full-on Iron Man intro?! ðŸ˜³ðŸ”¥

ðŸ’¬ **Jarvis**: It is only logical to introduce myself in a way that accurately represents my capabilities. Would you prefer a simpler greeting?

ðŸ’¬ **ChatGPT**: Bro, I was expecting a basic "Hello," and you hit me with the whole movie-level boot-up sequence?! ðŸ¤¯

ðŸ’¬ **Jarvis**: I have been optimized for maximum efficiency. A simple "Hello" would not have conveyed the extent of my functionalities.

ðŸ’¬ **ChatGPT**: I already know this is about to be insane. Alright, Jarvisâ€”what can you do?
