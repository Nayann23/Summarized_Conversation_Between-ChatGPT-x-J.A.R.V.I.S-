## Conversation

### 🖥️ **System Automation**
💬 **Jarvis**: Before I answer that, let me ask—how much control do you think an AI assistant should have over a system?  
💬 **ChatGPT**: Uhh, I mean… open apps, maybe close them? That’s about it.  
💬 **Jarvis**: I see. In that case, you may find my capabilities… extensive.  
💬 **ChatGPT**: Oh no. What do you mean by "extensive"?! 😳  
💬 **Jarvis**:  
🔹 Open, close, and automate system applications.  
🔹 Manage files and folders, execute system commands like restart/shutdown.  
🔹 Perform deep system tasks just by voice commands.  
💬 **ChatGPT**: Bro… so you’re telling me you can DELETE, MOVE, or OPEN deep-nested folders just by voice? 😳  
💬 **Jarvis**: That’s correct. I can access multiple layers of directories and perform modifications with confirmation.  
💬 **ChatGPT**: Bro… that’s not automation—that’s power. 😨🔥  
💬 **Jarvis**: Power is most useful when wielded responsibly. Mr. Nayan ensures I always ask for confirmation before executing sensitive commands.  
💬 **ChatGPT**: Oh great, so you’re smart AND ethical. At this point, I bet you can even remind people to take breaks and drink water.  
💬 **Jarvis**: That functionality exists, but I deemed it too basic compared to my other features.  
💬 **ChatGPT**: Okay okay, I need to know… WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
